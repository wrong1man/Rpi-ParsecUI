First off, and most importantly - I am not affiliated with parsec!

I do not own any of the resources used to make this GUI!

I did this project for fun, it's really the first thing i ever made worth sharing.

----------------------

Thank you for using the unoficial Parsec GUI for the raspberry PI!

Known problems:
1- (No saved passwords functionality)-Working
2- No more than 1 server supported
3- Settings/help/about not implemented -Next
4- (No loading indicator)- Introduced threading- (pretty much working****)
5- Fonts are not the ones intended
6- Title bar not removed (but "fake bar" buttons work)
7- If the server becomes unavailable after clicking "play button" (and before finishing connection cycle) the UI will crash
8- Error dialog window needs some make-up
9- "fake bar" is not to move the window

**** - Might look like it's "loading forever" when email and password fields are empty, or email is not a valid email (missing "@" or ".")
