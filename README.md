# Rpi-ParsecUI
Graphical user interface for Parsec on the Raspberry PI

-----------------------


First off, and most importantly - I am not affiliated with parsec!

I do not own any of the resources used to make this GUI!

I did this project for fun, it's really the first thing i ever made worth sharing.

----------------------

Thank you for using the unoficial Parsec GUI for the raspberry PI!

----------------------

Known problems:
1- No saved passwords functionality

2- No more than 1 server supported

3- Settings/help/about not implemented

4- No loading indicator

5- Fonts are not the ones intended

6- Title bar not removed (but "fake bar" buttons work)

7- If the server becomes unavailable after clicking "play button" (and before finishing connection cycle) the UI will crash

8- Error dialog window needs some make-up

9- "fake bar" is not to move the window
